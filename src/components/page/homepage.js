            A Computer Science graduate student with interests in Machine
            Learning and front-end development. School has really helped build
            my interest in developing smart systems while making sure they're
            usable at the same time. I just love combining technical
            problem-solving with the creativity of designing interfaces with
            strong knowledge in algorithms and programming.{" "}

            I’m all about machine learning because it’s the only field where
            overthinking is called feature engineering. I also create my own
            websites and nothing sparks joy quite like fixing a div that refuses
            to center, except maybe convincing myself the bug was a feature. I
            use Pytorch for my ML projects and React for the front-end tasks.{" "}

            Because I have a lot free time, I totally love touch typing, reading
            books, talking tech, space and science and I enjoy watching movies.{" "}
